Im currently working as an Associate Cloud Engineer for 8 momths 

My goal is to understand how the entire deployment lifecycle works not just restricted to Infra

I dont want to be vendor-lockin but i want ot grow mutliple skills and become an entry leve devops engineer.

I already know good amount of linux , networking , git-github. 

I want to master terraform , Python ,  docker , Jenkins by the end of this course and want to build a strong foundation in devops field.

I have to sit and learn for 2 hours  dedicatedly on weekdays and 5-6 hoirs on weekends. 

Consistency Matters more than perfection
